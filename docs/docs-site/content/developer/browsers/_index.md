## Jobs

Here are examples on how the Job Browser can list:

* [Impala queries](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/HUE-7420)
* [Livy jobs and sessions](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/HUE-6908)

By default, hooks to perform bulk operation like kill/pause/submit and retrieving details/logs are provided by the API.

## Files
Here is an example on how the File Browser can list HDFS, S3 files and [ADLS](https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/HUE-7248).

**Note** Ceph can be used via the S3 browser.
