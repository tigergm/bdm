## Quick Start Wizard

The Quick Start wizard allows you to perform the following Hue setup
operations by clicking the tab of each step or sequentially by clicking
Next in each screen:

1.  **Check Configuration** validates your Hue configuration. It will
    note any potential misconfiguration and provide hints as to how to
    fix them. You can edit the configuration file described in the next
    section or use Cloudera Manager, if installed, to manage your
    changes.
2.  **Examples** contains links to install examples into the Hive,
    Impala, MapReduce, Spark, Oozie, Solr Dashboard and Pig Editor applications.
3.  **Users** contains a link to the User Admin application to create or
    import users and a checkbox to enable and disable collection of
    usage information.

## Configuration

Displays a list of the installed Hue applications and their
configuration. The location of the folder containing the Hue
configuration files is shown at the top of the page. Hue configuration
settings are in the hue.ini configuration file.

Click the tabs under **Configuration Sections and Variables** to see the
settings configured for each application. For information on configuring
these settings, see Hue Configuration in the Hue installation manual.


Hue ships with a default configuration that will work for
pseudo-distributed clusters.  If you are running on a real cluster, you must
make a few changes to the `hue.ini` configuration file (`/etc/hue/hue.ini` when installed from the
package version) or `pseudo-distributed.ini` in `desktop/conf` when in development mode).
The following sections describe the key configuration options you must make to configure Hue.


<div class="note">
To list all available configuration options, run:

    $ /usr/share/hue/build/env/bin/hue config_help | less

This commands outlines the various sections and options in the configuration,
and provides help and information on the default values.
</div>


<div class="note">
To view the current configuration from within Hue, open:

    http://<hue>/hue/dump_config
</div>

<div class="note">
Hue loads and merges all of the files with extension `.ini`
located in the `/etc/hue` directory.  Files that are alphabetically later
take precedence.
</div>

# Administration

Now that you've installed and started Hue, you can feel free to skip ahead
to the <<usage,Using Hue>> section. Administrators may want to refer to this
section for more details about managing and operating a Hue installation.


## Configuration Validation

Hue can detect certain invalid configuration.

To view the configuration of a running Hue instance, navigate to
`http://myserver:8888/hue/dump_config`, also accessible through the About
application.


## Server Logs

Displays the Hue Server log and allows you to download the log to your
local system in a zip file.

## Threads

 blog post](http://gethue.com/easier-administration-of-hue-with-the-new-threads-and-metrics-pages/)

Threads page can be very helpful in debugging purposes. It includes a daemonic thread and the thread objects serving concurrent requests. The host name, thread name identifier and current stack frame of each are displayed. Those are useful when Hue “hangs”, sometimes in case of a request too CPU intensive. There is also a REST API to get the dump of Threads using 'desktop/debug/threads'

## Metrics

Read more on the [Threads and Metrics pages
 blog post](http://gethue.com/easier-administration-of-hue-with-the-new-threads-and-metrics-pages/)

Hue uses the **PyFormance** Python library to collect the metrics. These metrics are represented as gauge, counters, meter, rate of events over time, histogram, statistical distribution of values. A REST API endpoint '/desktop/metrics/' to get all the metrics dump as json is also exposed

The below metrics of most concern to us are displayed on the page:

- requests.active
- requests.exceptions
- requests.response-time
- threads.daemon
- threads.total
- users
- users.active

One of the most useful ones are the percentiles of response time of requests and the count of active users.
Admins can either filter a particular property in all the metrics or select a particular metric for all properties

## Process Hierarchy

A script called `supervisor` manages all Hue processes. The supervisor is a
watchdog process -- its only purpose is to spawn and monitor other processes.
A standard Hue installation starts and monitors the following processes:

* `runcpserver` - a web server based on CherryPy that provides the core web
functionality of Hue

If you have installed other applications into your Hue instance, you may see
other daemons running under the supervisor as well.

You can see the supervised processes running in the output of `ps -f -u hue`:

    UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
    hue       8685  8679  0 Aug05 ?        00:01:39 /usr/share/hue/build/env/bin/python /usr/share/hue/build/env/bin/desktop runcpserver

Note that the supervisor automatically restarts these processes if they fail for
any reason. If the processes fail repeatedly within a short time, the supervisor
itself shuts down.

## Logging

The Hue logs are found in `/var/log/hue`, or in a `logs` directory under your
Hue installation root. Inside the log directory you can find:

* An `access.log` file, which contains a log for all requests against the Hue
web server.
* A `supervisor.log` file, which contains log information for the supervisor
process.
* A `supervisor.out` file, which contains the stdout and stderr for the
supervisor process.
* A `.log` file for each supervised process described above, which contains
the logs for that process.
* A `.out` file for each supervised process described above, which contains
the stdout and stderr for that process.

If users on your cluster have problems running Hue, you can often find error
messages in these log files. If you are unable to start Hue from the init
script, the `supervisor.log` log file can often contain clues.

### Viewing Recent Log Messages

In addition to logging `INFO` level messages to the `logs` directory, the Hue
web server keeps a small buffer of log messages at all levels in memory. You can
view these logs by visiting `http://myserver:8888/hue/logs`. The `DEBUG` level
messages shown can sometimes be helpful in troubleshooting issues.

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot why Hue is slow or consuming high memory, admin can enable instrumentation by setting the `instrumentation` flag to True.
 <pre>
[desktop]
instrumentation=true
</pre>
 If `django_debug_mode` is enabled, instrumentation is automatically enabled. This flag appends the response time and the total peak memory used since Hue started for every logged request.

### Instrumentation enabled

<pre>
[17/Apr/2018 15:18:43 -0700] access       INFO     127.0.0.1 admin - "POST /jobbrowser/jobs/ HTTP/1.1" `returned in 97ms (mem: 135mb)`
</pre>

### Instrumentation not enabled

<pre>
[23/Apr/2018 10:59:01 -0700] INFO     127.0.0.1 admin - "POST /jobbrowser/jobs/ HTTP/1.1" returned in 88ms
</pre>

## Database

Hue requires a SQL database to store small amounts of data, including user
account information as well as history of job submissions and Hive queries.
By default, Hue is configured to use the embedded database SQLite for this
purpose, and should require no configuration or management by the administrator.
However, MySQL is the recommended database to use. This section contains
instructions for configuring Hue to access MySQL and other databases.

### Inspecting the Database

The default SQLite database used by Hue is located in: `/usr/share/hue/desktop/desktop.db`.
You can inspect this database from the command line using the `sqlite3`
program or typing `/usr/share/hue/build/env/bin/hue dbshell'. For example:

    sqlite3 /usr/share/hue/desktop/desktop.db
    SQLite version 3.6.22
    Enter ".help" for instructions
    Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"
    sqlite> select username from auth_user;
    admin
    test
    sample
    sqlite>

It is strongly recommended that you avoid making any modifications to the
database directly using SQLite, though this trick can be useful for management
or troubleshooting.

### Backing up the Database

If you use the default SQLite database, then copy the `desktop.db` file to
another node for backup. It is recommended that you back it up on a regular
schedule, and also that you back it up before any upgrade to a new version of
Hue.

### Configuring to Access Another Database

Although SQLite is the default database type, some advanced users may prefer
to have Hue access an alternate database type. Note that if you elect to
configure Hue to use an external database, upgrades may require more manual
steps in the future.

The following instructions are for MySQL, though you can also configure Hue to
work with other common databases such as PostgreSQL and Oracle.

<div class="note">
Note that Hue has only been tested with SQLite and MySQL database backends.

### Configuring to Store Data in MySQL

To configure Hue to store data in MySQL:

1. Create a new database in MySQL and grant privileges to a Hue user to manage
   this database.

    <pre>
    mysql> create database hue;
    Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
    mysql> grant all on hue.* to 'hue'@'localhost' identified by 'secretpassword';
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
    </pre>

2. Shut down Hue if it is running.

3. To migrate your existing data to MySQL, use the following command to dump the
   existing database data to a text file. Note that using the ".json" extension
   is required.

    <pre>
    /usr/share/hue/build/env/bin/hue dumpdata > $some-temporary-file.json
    </pre>

4. Open the `hue.ini` file in a text editor. Directly below the
   `[[database]]` line, add the following options (and modify accordingly for
   your MySQL setup):

    <pre>
    host=localhost
    port=3306
    engine=mysql
    user=hue
    password=secretpassword
    name=hue
    </pre>

5. As the Hue user, configure Hue to load the existing data and create the
   necessary database tables:

    <pre>
    /usr/share/hue/build/env/bin/hue syncdb --noinput
    mysql -uhue -psecretpassword -e "DELETE FROM hue.django_content_type;"
    /usr/share/hue/build/env/bin/hue loaddata $temporary-file-containing-dumped-data.json
    </pre>

Your system is now configured and you can start the Hue server as normal.
